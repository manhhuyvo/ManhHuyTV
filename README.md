# ManhHuyTV Practice Project that I have done using HTML, CSS, Javascript as Front End and PHP, SQL for building Back End
# You would need XAMPP and PHPMyAdmin to host the project and database locally
# Please download the whole project source code and paste it in folder "xampp/htdocs/ManhHuyTV"
# Find the database file in "database/manhhuytv.sql" and import the database into PHPMyAdmin
# Change the database name and other relevant details if needed
# Start the server and run the project! :)
